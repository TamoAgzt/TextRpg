Gameplay loop: prompt - options - choice - repeat
Options will eventually be like custom commands and should look like: ACTION TARGET
Example: Interact TavernKeeper, Attack Bandit1

Dialogue loops should look similar: prompt, response/choice, repeat

Response structure should be like the race picking at the start, with numbers.

When you enter a scene, you may get to see some interests and NPCs. By looking around and getting lucky, You may find more of these, giving you more options.

In a "scene", there should be an option to interact with every NPC present. These can be: speak, attack, leave. Every NPC you can speak to has a "good bye" option. You can attack any NPC, but some may receive help from nearby NPCs.
If an NPC is marked as hostile, speaking is not an option. If a character is marked as merchant, if you speak to them, you can barter.
